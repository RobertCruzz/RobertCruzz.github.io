            <p>This was a final project I completed at the end of my freshman year in Intermediate Software Development. The goal of this project was to create and display a simulation where an apocolypse type outbreak would occur. Using dots to represent people, The simulation starts with two infected people (red dots) and rapidly spreads to healthy people (blue dots). To help cure the disease I created a Doctor that had a vaccine(green dots). If an infected person came in to range of a doctor before a certain number of simulations occured they would be healed (yellow dots), else they would die and stop moving within the area (grey dots).</p>
